# SupernovaPrediction

I aim to train a machine learning model to be able to predict the rate of supernovae in high redshift galaxies.

I have chosen to try with a random forest regressor first. I can then run it with RandomSearchCV to make it better.

Currently I am searching for data sets that I could work with.
